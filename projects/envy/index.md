# Envy

The Envy project is an attempt to create a fast, reliable, portable (between
\*nix OSs) and easy to use desktop stack.

The existing desktop stacks (primarily driven by the over-engineered standards
created by [freedektop.org][]) have proven to be unreliable, slow and complex
beasts which reject portability (e.g. [GNOME][] and [KDE Plasma][]). At the
other extreme we find the user has to manually find and individually configure
many tools to create a functional desktop.

I find this situation to be unacceptable. There must be a middle ground, which
combines the best of both worlds and completely does away with the bad. The
Envy project is my solution to the problem. I plan to replace entire components
of the existing stacks with simpler, easier to use and more reliable
alternatives; designed to perfectly integrate with each other.

Eventually the goal is to package all of the Envy tools into a single OS
(EnvyOS). The tools will remain available for other systems as portability is a
key pillar for this project.
