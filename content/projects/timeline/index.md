# {{ title }}

The following is a list of my all of my projects, some of the early ones are
pretty basic, but you have to start somewhere.  This page explains the
motivation behind my projects and provides a permanent archive for the really
small ones.

---

## [Zepl.vim](https://github.com/axvr/zepl.vim)
<div class="date"><span title="2020-02-23 &ndash; Present">2020 &ndash; Present</span>&ensp;{{.active}}</div>

Zepl is a lightweight, simple and easy to use REPL integration package for Vim
8.1+ and Neovim.  It provides a small set of key bindings and commands to start
and interact with a running REPL.


## [MdView](https://github.com/axvr/MdView)
<div class="date"><span title="2020-01-28 &ndash; Present">2020 &ndash; Present</span>&ensp;{{.active}}</div>

The flexible Markdown control for Xamarin.Forms.


## [Ascribe](/projects/ascribe)
<div class="date"><span title="2019-04-21 &ndash; Present">2019 &ndash; Present</span>&ensp;{{.active}}</div>

Ascribe is a standard for software development tools (specifically editors) to
retrieve and handle information on the various files within a project through
the `.gitattributes` file already found in many software projects.

It is essentially an alternative to [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).


## [Photon.vim](https://github.com/axvr/photon.vim)
<div class="date"><span title="2019-03-23 &ndash; 2020-02-23"><span>2019 &ndash; 2020</span>&ensp;{{.complete}}</div>

An elegant, dark colour scheme with minimal syntax highlighting for Vim.

Photon is a low-contrast colour scheme, which cares about the little details.
It is based on an old version of paramount and is designed to look exactly the
same on 256 colour terminals as it does on true colour terminals.


##### Finished apprenticeship, stayed on.  2019-02


## [Org.vim](https://github.com/axvr/org.vim)
<div class="date"><span title="2018-11-03 &ndash; 2020-05-03">2018 &ndash; 2020</span>&ensp;{{.complete}}</div>

Org.vim is a minimal [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) plugin for Vim.  It
provides only the absolute necessities (e.g. syntax highlighting and folding)
at a high standard.

The main goal of this plugin is to replicate [Vim's default
Markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/) editing experience but for
Org mode files.


## [txtdb](https://github.com/axvr/txtdb)
<div class="date" title="2018-11-09 &ndash; 2019-03-03">2018 &ndash; 2019</div>

An attempt to create a simple database engine and RDBMS which stores the
table data in text files, using the CSV format.

This was started as a learning project to learn how databases, SQL and
compilers.

## [Code Dump](https://github.com/axvr/codedump)
<div class="date" title="2017-10-03 &ndash; Present">2017 &ndash; Present</div>

An archive of random code, programming notes and project assets I have created
over the years, ranging from experiments to fully functioning programs.


## [This website](https://github.com/axvr/axvr.github.io)
<div class="date"><span title="2017-09-09 &ndash; Present">2017 &ndash; Present</span>&ensp;{{.active}}</div>

This website was created.  Didn't look anything like it does now though.


## [Vivid.vim](https://github.com/axvr/vivid.vim)
<div class="date" title="2017-08-13 &ndash; 2018-11-07">2017 &ndash; 2018</div>

This version of Vivid was a rewrite of "Vivid-Legacy"; it's goals changed a lot
over the course of development.  Originally it was supposed to be a cleaner and
faster version of Vundle and make use of the Vim's new packages feature.  Later
it evolved into a "meta-plugin manager" where it acted as a plugin manager for
plugins (for dependency management).  Eventually I backtracked on that idea and
stripped it down completely releasing the final version in late 2018.  Shortly
after, I stopped using Vivid and switched to manually using Vim's native
package management.


## [dotfiles](https://github.com/axvr/dotfiles)
<div class="date" title="2017-04-16 &ndash; Present">2017 &ndash; Present</div>

A Git repository containing the configuration files I use for various
development tools.


## [Vivid-Legacy.vim](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid-Legacy.vim)
<div class="date" title="2017-04-06 &ndash; 2017-09-14">2017</div>

This was my second programming project; I had been using Vim for a while and
was particularly interested in how the plugin management side worked.  After
a couple of failed attempts to build a plugin manager, I forked
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) (which had been stagnant
since 2014) and began making minor tweaks.

Eventually I found that I would need to write one from scratch to get what
I wanted.  That rewrite inherited the name "Vivid", and this version became
"Vivid-Legacy".


## [ALIS (Arch Linux Installation Script)](https://github.com/axvr/alis)
<div class="date" title="2017-01-22 &ndash; 2017-10-30">2017</div>

ALIS was an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) installer.  This was my
first proper programming project.  I started it because the installer I had
previously been using ([Architect Linux](https://sourceforge.net/projects/architect-linux/))
had just stopped development and it as an opportunity to learn more about Linux
systems and programming by writing my own version of the installer from
scratch.


##### Began learning Vim.  2016-09


## [Thermoelectric generator (TEG)](/projects/teg)
<div class="date" title="2015-11-08 &ndash; 2016-02">2015 &ndash; 2016</div>

While taking part in a mini survival-like competition as a teenager, I thought
it would be interesting to see if it was possible to efficiently generate
electricity on a tiny budget.  The end result was capable of charging a mobile
phone.
