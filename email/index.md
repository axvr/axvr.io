# Email Address

To avoid spam, I have intentionally obfuscated my email address using various
methods, you can pick whichever of the following methods you would rather use
to reverse the obfuscation.

## The Interesting Methods

### Unix Shell

This one is easy, run the following command on a Unix shell, and my email
address will be magically revealed.

```
echo 'th4tjhq2bn' | tr 'a-z42' 'h-mu-zn-ta-g@.'
```

### Caesar Cipher

A pretty simple Caesar Cipher, but with a modified "alphabet" to add required
characters for my email address.

```
Plain:      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-_.@
Key:        18 - left shift
Ciphertext: mdlmfd@ku-
```

<details>
<summary>Click for a hint.</summary>

```
Cipher: mnopqrstuvwxyz-_.@abcdefghijkl
```

</details>

## The Boring Methods

### Instructions

1. Combine the initials of my fore- and surname.
2. Add an `@`
3. Add my website domain name.

### GitHub

If you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and are logged in, you
should be able to view my email address by visiting
[my profile](https://github.com/axvr).
