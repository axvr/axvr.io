## Software Projects

### [Vivid.vim](https://github.com/axvr/vivid.vim)

Vivid is a [Vim](https://www.vim.org) plugin manager, built to be minimal, fast
and efficient. Vivid provides Vim users with simple, but powerful tools, to
fine tune exactly when their plugins should be enabled.

### [Code Dump](https://github.com/axvr/codedump)

A repository full of random code which I have written, some of it is just
testing, and other bits are actual functioning programs. Come and take a look
around the "Code Dumpster", you may find something useful.
