	<div class="date">

	</div>

	<p>
		This version of Vivid was a rewrite of "<a href="#vivid-legacy">Vivid-Legacy</a>";
		it's goals changed a lot over the course of development.  Originally it was
		supposed to be a cleaner and faster version of Vundle and make use of the Vim's
		new packages feature.  Later it evolved into a "meta-plugin manager" where it
		acted as a plugin manager for plugins (for dependency management).  Eventually
		I backtracked on that idea and stripped it down completely releasing the final
		version in late 2018.  Shortly after, I stopped using Vivid and switched to
		manually using Vim's native package management.

		<span title="2017-04-06 &ndash; 2017-09-14">2017</span>
	</div>

	<p>
		This was my second programming project; I had been using Vim for a while and
		was particularly interested in how the plugin management side worked.  After
		a couple of failed attempts to build a plugin manager, I forked
		<a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim">Vundle</a> (which had been
		stagnant since 2014) and began making minor tweaks.
	</p>

	<p>
		Eventually I found that I would need to write one from scratch to get what
		I wanted.  That rewrite inherited the name "Vivid", and this version became
		"Vivid-Legacy".

	<div class="date">
		<span title="2017-01-22 &ndash; 2017-10-30">2017</span>
	</div>

	<p>
		ALIS was an <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> installer.  This
		was my first proper programming project.  I started it because the installer I
		had previously been using
		(<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/architect-linux/">Architect Linux</a>)
		had just stopped development and I saw it as an opportunity to learn more about
		Linux systems and programming by writing my own version of the installer from
		scratch.
