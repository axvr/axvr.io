# Ascribe project goals & scope

## Goals

Through Ascribe I want to promote the use of the `.gitattributes` file and
encourage the improvement of parsers for the file type.

I also want to promote good software design, meaning that all "official"
Ascribe extensions must meet extremely high code quality standards and aim to
be virtually bug free.

If you have have a question or have created an Ascribe extension and would like
to submit it to become an "official" extension, please don't hesitate to
[contact me](/contact).

## Scope

Fairly often I see people complaining about EditorConfig not supporting a
specific styling feauture they want. Most of the time this feature is about the
editor handling the placement of `{ }` (curly braces). Such features are outside
of the scope of both the Ascribe and EditorConfig projects because most editors
don't have configuration options for such features.
