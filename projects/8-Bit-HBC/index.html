    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I have been working on designing my own 8-Bit Computer for a while now, I
    do plan on building it at some point in the near future (hopefully).</p>

    <p>I would like to mention how this project will be done and why, I will be
    posting in project logs on this page, there will be many large spaces of
    time between updates as I do not typically get very much time to do
    extremely time consuming projects such as this (and also when I do I may
    choose to do something else instead). So sorry about that.</p>

    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>I have been working on designing my own 8-Bit Computer for a while now, I
    do plan on building it at some point in the near future (hopefully).</p>

    <p>This entire process will begin with me actually designing the computer
    using only logic gates. I do not have an excellent knowledge of how
    computers actually work at this level (same as most people). I understand
    the basic principles of how the entire thing would work, and how certain
    sections should work. I will be trying to do this without looking up the
    actual logic diagrams of the various components, but rather I will be trying
    to figure it out myself as I go along (help is obviously greatly
    appreciated). Most of what I know about the entire deign comes from an
    excellent talk from DEF CON 24 - Hacker Fundamentals and Cutting Through
    Abstraction - 1o57 which I highly recommend that everyone watches. It should
    be worth mentioning that this will most likely be designed using my own
    custom data transfer, and manipulation methods.</p>

    <h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>

    <p>I have always been intrigued by how computers work and how they do what
    they do. I have always lived by the philosophy that to know the basics,
    start from the top down, but to know everything about it, start from the
    ground up. Oh, and why not?</p>

    <h3>I would like to mention how this project will be done and why.</h3>

    <p>I will also be posting in project logs on this page, there will be many
    large spaces of time between updates as I do not typically get very much
    time to do extremely time consuming projects such as this (and also when I
    do I may choose to do something else instead). So sorry about that.</p>

    <p>All of the sections will be designed in two different versions; logic
    gates and an abstracted version, these will be able to be found under the
    files section of the page. When the design is finally finished I will piece
    all of the sections together and upload as a single file/document for anyone
    to use.</p>
