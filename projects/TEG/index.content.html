<p>I know that this page is full of grammatical mistakes (and other various
errors), but I am intentionally leaving it as such for historical reasons.  Only
a few minor changes have been made to the original content (mainly removing the
<a href="https://hackaday.io">Hackaday.io</a> terminology).</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Building a Thermoelectric generator cheaply for survival camps.  Designed
to be very efficient. (They are also known as Seebeck Generators).  The TEG
I am building will be able to power/charge a 5V (at 600mA) device through a
standard USB "Type A" port.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<h3>Why and how it works</h3>

<p>Thermoelectric generators (TEG) work in an extremely clever way. TEGs work
using peltier devices which are essentially two ceramic plates with
semiconductors in-between. These are normally used in fridges and kettles for
camping; when a current is placed across the peltier, it can cause it to rapidly
heat to boiling in just a few minutes, or simply by reversing the polarity it
can quickly drop below freezing point.</p>

<p>By reverse engineering these small devices; rather than placing the current
through them we give the device a temperature difference on each ceramic plate
it will produce D.C. voltage (Emf-Electromotive force [battery voltage]). The
higher the temperature difference the higher the voltage generated.</p>

<p>This works because rather than giving the peltiers electrical energy to
create heat (or negative heat), we are providing the heat to get electricity
from the device.</p>

                                        title="Diagram of the Seebeck Effect">

<p>It is known as the Seebeck effect (temperature difference to electricity),
the opposite of the Peltier effect (electricity to heat/temperature
difference).</p>

<h3>The Circuit Schematic: 3V, 1A to 5V, 600mA.</h3>

<p>This Schematic is a possible way to convert the output from the generator/s
to the required Current and Voltage. The 3V battery can be replaced with the
TEG. (Image: Adafruit - MintyBoost V2). For ease, the MintyBoost V3 can be used
instead and can be bought as a kit through <a
href="https://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>, the battery connectors can then be
attached to the correct leads on the TEG.</p>

<h3>The Module Design.</h3>

<p>The design of each of the modules of the circuit. (I have changed the design
slightly, as to what is seen above, so that it has holes on one side of the
bottom can, see below). Each can of the module were attached securely using duct
tape (sellotape in the prototype - above).</p>

<h2>Final Notes</h2>

<p>This device was a proof of concept, and performed brilliantly and fully
worked, with only four modules and four tea light candles, it was able to
charge a mobile phone to full charge. (I recommend not testing this on your
own phone as it may break it if the wiring was not correct or a component
was damaged).</p>

<p>At some point in the future I may try to make a more efficient version of
this. Feel free to use this design or modify it as you wish.</p>
