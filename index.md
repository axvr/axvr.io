Welcome to my website, this is where I document my ideas and projects.

I create original ideas and sometimes improve upon the ideas of others.  If an
idea meets or surpasses my high standards, I put it into practice.

If you would like to contact me, please do so via [email](/contact).

The source code for my software projects can be found on my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/axvr) and/or my
[Sourcehut profile](https://git.sr.ht/~axvr/) (username: `axvr`).
