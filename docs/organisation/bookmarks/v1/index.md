[\<-- back](../)

# Version 1

The inital version, 100% flat structure and as few categories as possible.

- [Websites](#websites)
- [Unread](#unread)
- [Read](#read)
- [Archive](#archive)
- [Keynotes](#keynotes)
- [Other](#other)

## Websites

Contains links to websites which I may want to go back to in the future. I am
usually very good at memorising URLs, so this folder will most likely just
contain pages which have complex URLs.

## Unread

Reading list of articles and books. Unlike services such as
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) this supports PDFs, and multi-page articles.

## Read

An archive of articles and books I have read, but may want to go back to in the
future. Similar to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)'s "Archive" feature.

## Archive

Links to pages containing lots of links (e.g. archive of all of Dijkstra's
papers). In other words, entire websites, rather than a specific pages.

## Keynotes

Links to videos, talks and keynotes.

## Other

Contains anything which doesn't fit into the other categories, for example
pages containing downloadable content.
