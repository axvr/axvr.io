# Cognition

Welcome to my testing ground (a.k.a. my website).

I create original ideas and sometimes improve upon the ideas of others. If an
idea meets or surpasses my high standards, I put it into practice.

I am currently on a quest to learn everything I possibly can about computers
and computation.

If you would like to contact me, please do so via [email](/contact).

The source code for my software projects can be found on my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/axvr) and/or my
[Sourcehut profile](https://git.sr.ht/~axvr/) (username: `axvr`).
