# Gait

As technology continues to advance at an ever increasing rate, the software
development industry is continually faced with more complex problems requiring
yet more complex solutions.  Should software developers be asking themselves:

> Are we trying to bolt "smart" layers onto systems which cannot support them?

Gait is a project trying to alter the way we think about building UIs. Gait is
aiming to design and create intelligent user interface frameworks which are
faster and more efficient than the existing solutions.

Gait is attempting to innovate in (and possibly invent) these areas:

- Tree-based page navigation.
- Recursive page rendering and navigation stack pointers.
- Data prefetching.
- Sharing context between pages.
- Providing core logic through command-line backends.
- Dual-layer garbage collection.
