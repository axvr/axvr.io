# Ascribe

### An alternative to [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).

The idea behind EditorConfig is an excellent one. It provides a mechanism to
automate the setting of core editor configuration options, for a huge number of
editors and other development tools on a per-project basis.

EditorConfig is undoubtedly a very useful tool, but I think I can do one
better.
