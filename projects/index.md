## Software Projects

### [Vivid.vim](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim)

Vivid is a [Vim](https://www.vim.org) plugin management solution; designed to
work with, not against Vim. Vivid also acts as the foundation for Vim "layers"
through the _VLF_ (_Vivid Layer Framework_).

### [dotnet.vim](https://github.com/axvr/dotnet.vim)

A Vim "layer" aiming to significantly improve the .NET Core development
experience for Vim users.

### [Code Dump](https://github.com/axvr/codedump)

A repository full of random code which I have written, some is just general
testing others are actual functioning programs. Come and take a look around the
"Code Dumpster", you may find something useful.
