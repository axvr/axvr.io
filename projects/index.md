# Software Projects

### [Vivid.vim](https://github.com/axvr/vivid.vim)

Vivid is a [Vim](https://www.vim.org) plugin manager, built to be minimal, fast
and efficient. Vivid provides Vim users with simple, but powerful tools, which
allow them to fine tune exactly when their plugins should be enabled.

### [txtdb](https://github.com/axvr/txtdb)

An attempt to create a simple [database engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_engine)
and [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDBMS) which stores the table data in
text files, using the [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
format.

### [Org.vim](https://github.com/axvr/org.vim)

A minimal [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) plugin for Vim. It provides only the
absolute necessities (e.g. syntax highlighting, indentation, folding, etc.).
The goal of this plugin is to replicate Vim's existing
[Markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/) editing experience for
Org-mode files.

### [Code Dump](https://github.com/axvr/codedump)

A repository of random code, programming notes and project assets I have
created, ranging from experiments to fully functioning programs.

design and build a "simple" 8-bit computer completely from scratch.

### [Cheap Thermoelectric Generator](/projects/TEG)

Building a Thermoelectric generator as cheaply as possible, capable of charging
a mobile phone, using the Seebeck Effect.
