# Version 2

A simple extension to the initial version, sub-folders have been introduced,
and the "Articles" folder and missing folders for keynote watch status were
added.

- [Articles](#articles)
  - [Unread](#unread)
  - [Read](#read)
- [Keynotes](#keynotes)
  - [Watch](#watch)
  - [Viewed](#viewed)
- [Archive](#archive)
- [Websites](#websites)
- [Other](#other)

The parent folders are optional (_Articles_ and _Keynotes_), since I have
carefully named the sub-folders to ensure it is obvious what they contain.

## Articles

Articles, books, wiki pages, etc.

### Unread

Reading list of articles and books. Unlike services such as
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), this supports PDFs, and multi-page articles.

### Read

An archive of articles and books I have read, but may want to go back to in the
future. Similar to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)'s "Archive" feature.

## Keynotes

Links to videos, talks and keynotes.

### Watch

"Watch later" list of videos and keynotes. This category replaces the
need for YouTube's "Watch Later" folder, and it also supports content
from any other site.

### Viewed

An archive of keynotes and videos I have watched, and may want to
refer to or watch again in the future.

## Archive

Anything I would like to archive the entirety of. This category will
likely mostly consist of index pages, rather than individual pages.

## Websites

Contains links to websites which I may want to go back to in the
future. I am usually very good at memorising URLs, so this folder will
most likely just contain pages which have complex URLs.

## Other

Contains anything which doesn't fit into the other categories, for
example pages containing downloadable content.
