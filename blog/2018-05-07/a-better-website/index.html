    <p>I have recently redesigned my website from the ground up, and there are
    some things I would like to mention about why it was designed this way.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>No JavaScript. Plain HTML and CSS static website.</li>
        <li>No analytics or cookies.</li>
        <li>No advertisements, the site is not trying to manipulate the
            visitors.</li>
        <li>No clutter. The page layout should be simple, and easy to use and
            read.</li>
        <li>Viewable on any device or browser. Although the site was built using
            CSS Grid a relatively new CSS technology, the site is still fully
            functional and viewable in any browser, and scales appropriately to
            fit the dimensions of any device while maintaining full ease of
            readability. It should even work perfectly with terminal web
            browsers</li>
        <li>No dependence upon anything. Anything the site needs it is hosting
            itself.  e.g. fonts (no reliance on Google)</li>
        <li>Open Source. The site is licenced under the ISC licence, and the
            content under the CC-BY-4.0 licence. And it makes this clear to the
            visitors.</li>
        <li>Simple static HTML page generator. I custom made the HTML page
            generator to be as simple as possible, and follow the Unix
            philosophy (it is also fully POSIX compliant - no
            GNU/Bash-isms).</li>
        <li>Fully compatible with html readers (e.g. Pocket and Firefox reader
            view)</li>
        <li>Consistent, the page should not change in a way the viewer was not
            expecting while navigating the site</li>
        <li>Not HTML Hell. http://www.catb.org/~esr/html-hell.html</li>
        <li>Works perfectly for those who refuse to use closed source /
            proprietary software, including JavaScript</li>
        <li>Decentralised or able to move easily. My website can easily be moved
            to a different hosting provider, or be self hosted easily, because
            although I am using GitHub Pages to host the site, I am not using
            Jekell to generate the site.</li>
        <li>RSS feed, all websites which contain a blog should provide an RSS
            feed for that blog.</li>
        <li>SSL. Need I say more.</li>
        <li>Try to prevent link rot. e.g. when referencing/linking to PDFs try
            to provide copies yourself, when the copyright allows it (or is
            contained within the document).</li>
        <li>No pop ups. Why these are even still a thing I don't know.</li>
        <li>Works with adblockers.</li>
        <li>decent max width, for easy reading, don't do a wikipedia and span
            the content to the width of the screen, it becomes difficult to
            read</li>
        <li>Little complexity</li>
    </ul>
