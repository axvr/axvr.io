# Projects and contributions

In my free time I work on various open-source and free-software projects.
Sometimes I do hardware projects.

## Active projects

- [Ascribe](ascribe) - An EditorConfig alternative.
- [Photon.vim](https://github.com/axvr/photon.vim) - A minimal and elegant dark
  colour scheme for Vim.
- [txtdb](https://github.com/axvr/txtdb) - A transparent RDBMS and DB engine
  to help teach about databases.
- [Org.vim](https://github.com/axvr/org.vim) - A minimal Org-mode plugin for
  Vim providing only the absolute necessities.
- [8-bit homebrew computer](8-bit-hbc) - I'm working on designing and building
  a simple 8-bit computer from scratch.

## Completed projects

- [Thermoelectric Generator](/projects/teg) - Creating a thermoelectric
  generator capable of charging a mobile phone for as little money as possible.
- [Vivid.vim](https://github.com/axvr/vivid.vim) - An extremely minimal Vim
  plugin manager focused on providing users with maximum control over when
  their plugins are enabled. _I no longer use this_.

## Archived/deprecated projects

- [ALIS](https://github.com/axvr/alis) - An Arch Linux installer. This was my
  first programming project, it is embarassing how bad the code quality is.

## Contributed to

- [OmniSharp-Vim](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim) - I wrote the
  automatic installer for both MS Windows and Unix-like OSs.  I occasionally
  fix bugs and help resolve issues.
