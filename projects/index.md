# Software Projects

### [Photon.vim](https://github.com/axvr/photon.vim)

Photon is a low-contrast colour scheme for [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), which
cares about the little details.  It is based on an old version of
[paramount](https://github.com/owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount) and is designed
to look exactly the same on 256 colour terminals as it does on true colour
terminals.

### [Vivid.vim](https://github.com/axvr/vivid.vim)

Vivid is a [Vim](https://www.vim.org) plugin manager, built to be minimal, fast
and efficient. Vivid provides Vim users with simple, but powerful tools, which
allow them to fine tune exactly when their plugins should be enabled.

### [txtdb](https://github.com/axvr/txtdb)

An attempt to create a simple [database engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_engine)
and [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDBMS) which stores the table data in
text files, using the [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
format.

### [Org.vim](https://github.com/axvr/org.vim)

A minimal [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) plugin for
[Vim](https://www.vim.org). It provides only the absolute necessities (e.g.
syntax highlighting and folding) at a high standard.
