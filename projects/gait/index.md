# Gait

### Taking a different stride in UI development.

As technology continues to advance at an ever increasing rate, the software
development industry is continually faced with more complex problems requiring
yet more complex solutions.

> Are we trying to bolt "smart" layers onto systems which cannot support them?

Gait is a project trying to alter the way we think about building UIs and
designing intelligent user interface frameworks which are faster and more
efficient than the existing solutions.

Gait is attempting to innovate in (and possibly invent) these areas:

- Tree-based page navigation.
- Recursive page rendering and navigation stack pointers.
- Data prefetching.
- Sharing context between pages.
- Dual-layer garbage collection.
- Providing core logic through command-line backends.
