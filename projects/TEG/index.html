    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>How to build a Thermoelectric generator cheaply for survival camps.
    Designed to be very efficient. (They are also known as Seebeck Generators).
    The TEG I am building will be able to power/charge a 5V (at 600mA) device
    through a standard USB "Type A" port.</p>

    <h2>Details</h2>

    <h3>Why and how it works</h3>

    <p>Thermoelectric generators (TEG) work in an extremely clever way. TEGs
    work using peltier devices which are essentially two ceramic plates with
    semiconductors in-between. These are normally used in fridges and kettles
    for camping; when a current is placed across the peltier, it can cause it to
    rapidly heat to boiling in just a few minutes, or simply by reversing the
    polarity it can quickly drop below freezing point.</p>

    <p>By reverse engineering these small devices; rather than placing the
    current through them we give the device a temperature difference on each
    ceramic plate it will produce D.C. voltage (Emf-Electromotive force [battery
    voltage]). The higher the temperature difference the higher the voltage
    generated.</p>

    <p>This works because rather than giving the peltiers electrical energy to
    create heat (or negative heat), we are providing the heat to get electricity
    from the device.</p>

    <img src="images/seebeck-effect.jpg" alt="The Seebeck Effect">

    <p>It is known as the Seebeck effect (temperature difference to
    electricity), the opposite of the Peltier effect (electricity to
    heat/temperature difference).</p>

    <h3>The Circuit Schematic: 3V, 1A to 5V, 600mA.</h3>

         alt="Adafruit - MintyBoost V2 Schematic">

    <p>This Schematic is a possible way to convert the output from the
    generator/s to the required Current and Voltage. The 3V battery can be
    replaced with the TEG. (Image: Adafruit - MintyBoost V2). For ease, the
    MintyBoost V3 can be used instead and can be bought as a kit through <a
    href="https://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a>, the battery connectors can then be
    attached the the correct leads on the TEG.</p>

    <h3>The Module Design.</h3>

    <p>The design of each of the modules of the circuit. (I have changed the
    design slightly, as to what is seen above, so that it has holes on one side
    of the bottom can, see below). Each can of the module were attached securely
    using duct tape (sellotape in the prototype - above).</p>

    <h2>Final Notes</h2>

    <p>This device was a proof of concept, and performed brilliantly and fully
    worked, with only four modules and four tea light candles, it was able to
    charge a mobile phone to full charge. (I recommend not testing this on your
    own phone as it may break it if the wiring was not correct or a component
    was damaged).</p>

    <p>At some point in the future I will try to make a more efficient version
    of this. Feel free to use this design or modify it as you wish.</p>
