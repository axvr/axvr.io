###TITLE###:8-Bit Homebrew Computer

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
    I have been working on designing my own 8-Bit Computer for a while now, I do
    plan on building it at some point in the near future (hopefully).
    </p>

    <p>
    I would like to mention how this project will be done and why, I will be
    posting in project logs on this page, there will be many large spaces of
    time between updates as I do not typically get very much time to do
    extremely time consuming projects such as this (and also when I do I may
    choose to do something else instead). So sorry about that.

    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>
    I have been working on designing my own 8-Bit Computer for a while now, I do
    plan on building it at some point in the near future (hopefully).

    <p>
    This entire process will begin with me actually designing the computer using
    only logic gates. I do not have an excellent knowledge of how computers
    actually work at this level (same as most people). I understand the basic
    principles of how the entire thing would work, and how certain sections
    should work. I will be trying to do this without looking up the actual logic
    diagrams of the various components, but rather I will be trying to figure it
    out myself as I go along (help is obviously grealy appreciated). Most of
    what I know about the entire deign comes from an excellent talk from DEF CON
    24 - Hacker Fundamentals and Cutting Through Abstraction - 1o57 which I
    highly recommend that everyone wach. It should be worth mentioning that this
    will most likely be designed using my own custom data transfer, and
    manipulation methods.

    <h4>Why am I doing this?</h4>

    <p>
    I have always been intrigued by how computers work andhow they do what they
    do. I have always lived by the philosophy that to know the basics, start
    from the top down, but to know everything about it, start from the ground
    up.

    <p>
    Oh, and why not?

    <h4>I would like to mention how this project will be done and why.</h4>

    <p>
    Everything I upload and you can find on this project page can be used
    anywhere because others may find it to be useful. All that I ask is that, I
    will retain credit for my work where possible.
    </p>

    <p>
    I will also be posting in project logs on this page, there will be many
    large spaces of time between updates as I do not typically get very much
    time to do extremely time consuming projects such as this (and also when I
    do I may choose to do something else instead). So sorry about that.
    </p>

    <p>
    All of the sections will be designed in two different versions; logic gates
    and an abstracted version, these will be able to be found under the files
    section of the page. When the design is finally finished I will piece all of
    the sections together and upload as a single file/document for anyone to
    use.
