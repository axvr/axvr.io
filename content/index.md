# Who am I?

I'm a software developer at [Numerous Technology](https://numerous.app).
I spend my free time learning, writing and working on personal projects.

Currently I'm trying to improve the ways we design, program and use computers
through the creation of tools to make it easier to build rich interactive GUI
applications, design custom processor architectures and much more.

Please send any questions, comments and corrections to me via [email](contact).
