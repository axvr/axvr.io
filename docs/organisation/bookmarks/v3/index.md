# Version 3 (Experimental)

Version 3 is a trial version, there are several new features which are
being tested. The first of which is the "Projects" folder, which
contains various sub folders for each project.

The second feature being trialed is "tags", which provide a mechanism
for categorisation of items, where each item can have multiple
tags. The initial way I am testing this, is by tagging "authors",
e.g. "Rich Hickey", "Rob Pike", etc.

# Issues with tags since they only work in Firefox (but not on Firefox
